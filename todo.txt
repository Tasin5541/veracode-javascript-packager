- Maybe ignore map files in `public`
    - Maybe remove `public` and `dist`?

- Add it to the NPM registry
- Add functionality to explicitly include certain files that my packager excludes (sample use case: `node_modules` may contain 2nd party code)
- Include a date and output something like `vc-output-<date>.zip`
- No default value for `-tests` anymore 
- Test Angular, Vue, and React project and rename to "Veracode JavaScript Packager" and update README that it includes Node, Angular, React and Vue
