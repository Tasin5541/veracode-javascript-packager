- Add it to the NPM registry
- Add functionality to explicitly include certain files that my packager excludes (sample use case: `node_modules` may contain 2nd party code)
- Remove all .json that are not bower.json, package.json, package-lock.json
- Dry run functionality

- Have a test to check e.g. if a `.js` file exists in the folder to zip up and otherwise say something like "You're sure this is the correct folder?"

- `-t` instead of `-target`
    - Maybe use this tool for flag aliases: https://pkg.go.dev/rsc.io/getopt
    - Or maybe https://www.thorsten-hans.com/lets-build-a-cli-in-go-with-cobra/
