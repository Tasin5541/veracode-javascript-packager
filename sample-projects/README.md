# Sample Test Apps

* This folder contains example apps for the supported frameworks
    - The project for Node.js was created by us and should contain quite a lot of edge cases
    - The other projects are "real-world" examples from `GitHub`
* For testing, you may want to install them by running `npm install` within each of them (and `yarn install` for the `./sample-vue-project`)
